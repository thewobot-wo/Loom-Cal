## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Convex-native events only in v1 — no Apple Calendar (EventKit) or Supabase integration (deferred to v2)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Telegram reply routing — Loom writes to Convex `chat_messages` table, iOS subscribes reactively (requires Loom MCP write access configured before Phase 4)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: All Convex integer fields use `v.int64()` / `@ConvexInt` in Swift — standard Int silently fails

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: HorizonCalendar Mac target behavior unverified — needs hands-on testing in Phase 1; fallback is custom SwiftUI calendar grid (~2-3 weeks additional)
- [Phase 1]: ConvexMobile minimum Swift version not confirmed — verify before setting Xcode build settings
- [Phase 4]: Loom MCP must have write access to `chat_messages` Convex table — coordinate Loom config before Phase 4 planning
- [Phase 5]: Convex background subscription behavior on iOS not documented — test in Phase 4/5 before notification implementation
