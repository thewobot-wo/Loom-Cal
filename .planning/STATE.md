# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** One app where you see everything on your plate — calendars, tasks, projects — and chat with Loom to actively manage your day.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation)
Plan: 1 of TBD in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-20 — Plan 01 complete; Convex schema and backend functions deployed

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.07 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4 min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Convex-native events only in v1 — no Apple Calendar (EventKit) or Supabase integration (deferred to v2)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Telegram reply routing — Loom writes to Convex `chat_messages` table, iOS subscribes reactively (requires Loom MCP write access configured before Phase 4)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: All Convex integer fields use `v.int64()` / `@ConvexInt` in Swift — standard Int silently fails
- [Plan 01-01]: Studio events deduplication uses title field match — replace with Supabase PK once schema confirmed
- [Plan 01-01]: _generated stubs committed for pre-deploy TypeScript type-checking; overwritten by npx convex dev on first deploy
- [Plan 01-01]: syncFromSupabase handles both snake_case and camelCase Supabase field names for robustness

### Pending Todos

- User must run `npx convex dev` to link Convex project and deploy schema/functions
- User must set SUPABASE_EVENTS_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in Convex Dashboard environment variables

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: HorizonCalendar Mac target behavior unverified — needs hands-on testing in Phase 1; fallback is custom SwiftUI calendar grid (~2-3 weeks additional)
- [Phase 1]: ConvexMobile minimum Swift version not confirmed — verify before setting Xcode build settings
- [Phase 4]: Loom MCP must have write access to `chat_messages` Convex table — coordinate Loom config before Phase 4 planning
- [Phase 5]: Convex background subscription behavior on iOS not documented — test in Phase 4/5 before notification implementation
- [Phase 1 - User Action Required]: npx convex dev must be run interactively to link Convex project and generate real _generated/ files
